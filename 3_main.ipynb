    "### 1.1 Primary Objective \n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Aim: How much of Hulkenburg's podium in the British Grand Prix 2025 can be attributed to optimial pit strategy vs. raw pace and in-race decisions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis: I believe that the raw pace of the car had little to do with this victory. I think it is more likely an even combination of Nico making the decision to pit at the right time, and many teams making a less optimal decision.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The British Grand Prix in 2025 was a spectacle for those watching. Due to unusual conditions (intermittent wet weather and various shunts) many teams likely would have had to abandon their pre-race strategy briefs and adjust on the fly to the changing conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of such races was the British Grand Prix in 2025. Nico Hulkenburg driving the Sauber was in a car that during this season, was quite poor. With an average finishing position of XX and ??, this car was destined for the bottom of the grid most races. But for whatever reason, during this Grand Prix weekend, Nico was able to drag the car to the podium.\n",
    "\n",
    "So were Nico's instincts spot on, or did he get lucky, with other drivers choosing less-optimal, safer pits. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also briefly explore what is meant by an optimal pit stop and dig through the data available to see if it paints Nico as a instinctual genius, or a fortuitous driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Why this topic?\n",
    "\n",
    "Something that has always surprised me about Formula 1 races (and any racing code for that matter) is that no matter a cars seemingly superior performance, occasionally, it seems as if the driver is able to pull a rabit out of a hat so to speak and.\n",
    "\n",
    "These teams have an inordinate amount of resources dedicated to managing \n",
    "\n",
    "I was also curious watching this race what on earth was going on strategy wise and how the teams managed their races\n",
    "\n",
    "F1 interests me in many ways. Look to Piere Gasley's maiden win and more recently Hulkenburg's surprise podium late in his career. Although fortuitous circumstances aided in their respective achievements, generally, strategy comes down to pitting at the right moment. Maintaining pace and keeping track position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 What I hope to learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Increase my comfortability working with Python and analysing somewhat disconnected and messy data sets from API's and other sources. Also get a better idea of what is expected from a data analysis project and how I might improve my analyses in future."
